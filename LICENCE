All the files under t/pv, all under t/lib/PVTests, and t/lib/PVTests.pm
are taken from Params::Validate, so that I can test that
Params::Validate::Dependencies is backward-compatible and properly
wraps Params::Validate.

They are Copyright (c) 2011 by Dave Rolsky and Ilya Martynov and are
licenced to you under The Artistic Licence 2.0 (GPL Compatible).

You may find a copy of that licence in the file ARTISTIC2.txt.

Everything else is dual-licenced under either the GNU General Public
Licence version 2 or the original Artistic Licence.  It's your choice
which one (or both) you use.  You can find the text of those licences
in GPL2.txt and ARTISTIC.txt.
