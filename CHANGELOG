2013-06-16      1.21    Bugfix. UNIVERSAL::can($class, 'can') always
                          returns true in 5.18, even if the class has
                          never been seen before. Now check for class
                          existence by checking its @ISA

2013-06-12      1.2     validate() now returns what it checked, like
                          Params::Validate::validate

2012-11-26      1.13    Changes in D::D::D to cope with incompatible
                          changes in new Data::Domain

2011-09-02      1.12    Bugfix Documenter.pm to replace *all* underscores
                          in function names

2011-09-01      1.11    Reduce dependency versions (this is mostly for my
                          employer's benefit - no functional changes)

2011-08-22      1.1     Make *_of self-documenting

2011-08-17      1.00    Initial release
